# Translating R code

**Learning objectives:**

- Why translating R code may be useful
- An overview of Domain Specific Languages (DSL)
- Walkthrough translating R code into HTML

## Why translate?

- easier to work iteratively
- can wrap a common operation in a function
- may want to keep it in one language, easier to collaborate with others

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)

mf <- memdb_frame(x = 1, y = 2)

mf |>  
  mutate(
    a = y * x, 
    b = a ^ 2,
  ) %>% 
  show_query()
```

## DSL

> The basic idea of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is a computer language that's targeted to a particular kind of problem, rather than a general purpose language that's aimed at any kind of software problem. Domain-specific languages have been talked about, and used for almost as long as computing has been done.

> DSLs are very common in computing: examples include CSS, regular expressions, make, rake, ant, SQL, HQL, many bits of Rails, expectations in JMock, graphviz's dot language, FIT, strut's configuration file....

## HTML

- powerful DSL for webpages

- an example:

```{html}
<body>
  <h1 id='first'>A heading</h1>
  <p>Some text &amp; <b>some bold text.</b></p>
  <img src='myimg.png' width='100' height='100' />
</body>
```

`<` and `>` have special meanings in HTML
need to use **escapes**: `&gt;` and `&lt;`

`&amp;` for `&`
